Although they are not the 110 of course, all of my comments apply to the 110 as well since within this model range they are based upon the same basic design.\n\nPROs:\n\nMy family uses them all the time when we're out riding our bikes. I especially like them at amusement parks because we sometimes split up, and over reasonable distances can use them to communicate and find each other. I believe Garmin holds the patent for transmitting locational information in the way that they do for these types of radios. Very handy.\n\nCONs:\n\nOn the other hand I think there are two main design problems. The minor one is that the battery compartment spring connectors wiggle loose over time and with no capacitor to ride through a millisecond of loss of power, the units simply crash or die. The more major problem is that the only way to update these rinos (maps, software updates, etc.) is through an old obsolete DB9 serial cable. No modern computer even comes with serial connectors anymore! Seriously Garmin, you've already gotten a huge return on investment in your design that is well over a decade old now - can't you even see your way clear to refresh the computer interface so that your customers can download maps (which you also sell) on a modern computer? (Note: the more modern/expensive rino models do have better interfaces, but the low end models are stuck in the past with an unusable connector. If you have to have a rino, get a different model.)\n\nI love the concept, but I can't recommend any product that can no longer communicate. It would be like asking someone to recommend an old analog NTSC TV set. Just say no.\nAnswer:",

Once assembled, the pole was extremely wobbly since (1) the ground sleeve was too short to keep the lower pole piece firmly in place, and (2) the top pole section, once inserted into the bottom, is very unstable.  Better solution is to just go to your local fence supplier and buy an 11 foot section of 1 5/8 inch or 1 3/4 inch fence post and matching ground sleeve (min 12 inches, or longer - just make sure to extend the pole length to accomodate the longer ground sleeve).  Then just buy the rope and ball set.  My local fence co charged $25, and that included a cap and eye ring at one end so I could connect a teatherball rope.

In the process of a remodel I placed four temperature probes (two from other devices) in a box. When the work was complete I attempted to link the probes with the proper timer/thermometer devices. Not easily done!!!  Polder, it turns out, has a different probe connector for each of its models. Unfortunately, the thermometer/timers do not identify themselves as to which model it is. The directions do identify the model but there is no picture and the probes have no indication as to which model they belong to. Couple that with the worst navigation in modern internet information, the lack of information available on some models that are still available (new), and you are left with no help for putting the right items together, no way to identify the matching item if they could be identified. No model numbers on the items and the customer service at Polder tells you they will send out information and then do not. They certainly will send a probe to you for $10+ (on a $20 item), but not tell you how to identify which thermometer the probe fits. (You won't know anyway as the thermometer or the probe doesn't have a model number on it.) Seriously, how difficult would it be to color code the probe with the thermometer receptacle, identify both the probe and the thermometer with a model number, post directions and a guide to matching items? This is Marketing 101.  The thermometers work fine but only if you put the correct probe in the correct thermometer. (Why six different probes that don't work in any but the matching thermometer--which is not identified by a picture or a model number). Polder hasn't a clue when it comes to the customer. Bad, bad, marketing.  If you have only one thermometer/timer and one probe you're probably OK, but if something goes awry you're screwed.  Polder doesn't get it.\nAnswer:",

I bought an Insinkerator Badger 5 garbage disposal less than 7 years ago and had to replace it last week due to leakage.  At the time I had a professional plumber install it so know that it was not due to an installation problem.  I never use any chemical or drain cleaners and  do not heavily use any disposal  I recently read online that leakage was and maybe is a common problem with this product.  I wish I knew about this problem years ago but will never buy an Insinkerator disposal again.  I feel that the company should have issued a recall and a refund or new disposal as soon as they learned about the problem.  The reply I received from my complaint seemed to imply that 7-8 years was a good lifetime for this garbage disposal.  Silly me, I expected at least 10 years of usage from it.\nAnswer:",

However, it was a great little point and shoot camera that took at least 20 - 30 photos without any problems. We filled up the memory before we used up the battery life. Because we were comfortable with the Kodak we had, we went ahead and bought the Kodak 3700 camera for my daughter's 16th birthday only to be completely disappointed months later. The camera has almost never worked correctly. After a few months we started experiencing the charging problems just like many others who have posted their reviews here. The camera takes 1 or 2 pics and then the battery is dead. We thought perhaps our daughter never charged the battery correctly when it was brand new, so we replaced the lithium battery, but the problems did not resolve. We tried rechargeable batteries, but the problems did not resolve. We thought it might be the camera dock and tried at a friend's house, but the problem still did not resolve. This product is junk and should have been recalled as there is an obvious manufacturer's defect. Kodak has offered no resolve or replacement. Too little information too late for us, but heed the warning for those looking to buy this camera today. DON'T DO IT!!!!!\nAnswer:",

Whatever I recorded- the audio was fine but the picture just kept rolling. If you put the VCR on pause and then hit play it plays ok for a few seconds and then it starts rolling all over again. When I try to rewind the tapes 2 of the 4 tapes stop rewinding and shut the VCR off. When I turn the VCR back on, the tape pops out and I have to go over to the set and push the tape back in and hit rewind again. It takes about 3 or 4 times of doing this to get back to the beginning of the tape. VERY annoying. It's not the VCR as I have tried it in a couple of different machines with the same results.

The water pump broke at the second use today. I am returning it. Total life: 3 hours.\n\nTo be fair, I might just got a defective unit. It performs decently before it died. The suction is strong, although not as strong as I was expecting after reading the reviews. The water tanks are non-detachtable. To some this is a handicap but to me it is an advantage. The detachtable tanks, unless vented upward, will develop leaks sooner or later.\n\nThe waste tank has a floating valve that will block air flow at certain water level to prevent water being sucked into the motor. The designer's calculation must be a little off because the shut off occurs when the waste tank is less than half full and the clean water tank still has one third of water left. The tanks are already tiny. This miscalculation means a lot of trips to the water tap if you are washing a big area. Each change of water can wash about 3 feet x 3 feet area one pass. This is quite adequate if you only use it to clean up after accidents or wash upholstery. Washing an average room 2 passes will take 20 or more  trips to the tap, not bad if you have a little extra calories/weight to burn/lose...\n\nAs for the water pump, It is a clever design. Air is sucked in from an opening at the bottom and channeled through a turbine that drives a centrofugal pump. It is not the most efficient design but save the need for an extra motor. The bearing/seal between the turbine and the pump is just its plastic casing. It will be just a mater of time that the casing gets worn down the water starts to leak out from the turbine;s air intake. My unit's turbine managed to break free from the axle.\nAnswer:",

For about four years, I have been using the Festool 6\" Rotex 150 but it goes through motor brushes about every year.  So, I thought a change was in order.  I bought the Fein sander hoping not only to solve the motor brush problem but maybe improve over the Festool.  There is absolutely no comparison.  The Festool is a far better sander.\n\n  Controling the Fein is difficult at best.  When sanding narrow pieces like a cabinet face frame, the Fein jumps around.  When sanding larger areas, the Fein sucks down onto the work piece making it more difficult to move.  Long periods of sanding with the Fein are a struggle.  The Fein is aggresive but, when you want less agressive sanding, you don't have a choice since it is only one speed not variable.  I am especially disappointed in the amount of vibration the Fein has.  The worse thing of all is the poor quality when sanding with high grit paper for the final pass.  One other downer is the high cost and lack of availability of sand paper for the Fein.  And if all that isn't enough, I emailed Fein regarding problems trying to register my sander online for the extra 2 year warranty.  I never heard from them.  By the way, I spoke with a Fein representative prior to buying the sander and told him I already have a Festool.  He said Fein is the best.  So much for honest salesmanship.\n\n If you don't want the above problems, go with Festool.  The motor brush problem is the only down side and that might just be a problem with the one I have.  Other people have told me they have never changed motor brushes in their Festool sander.  The price is about the same on both sanders.\nAnswer:",

After having done several projects now, I am not all that happy with it.  I bought it based on the Freud name and the price.  Does it work, yes.  I can't get flat bottom dado's... Every single time, my dado's have grooving from the outer blades.  This has been true with the 5 different dado widths I have cut.  Bummer..  The holes in the blades are not all the same diameter, this is a minimal difference but some don't even fit on my arbor...  Some are a bit loose... This would probably explain the grooves left in my dado's, and why some people have flat dado's and some don't...  As far as the setup chart with shims and chippers goes... The width configurations are confusing.. This has led to a lot of time testing out shim and chipper configurations... An example of confusing shim/stack setup is 13/32\" and 15/32\" have the exact same configuration, with no further explanation...  So what is the real measurement of stack A+B+C+D+S1+S2 if two measurements are given? It would have been a lot better to get an actual cut width and ply width designation.  It can be figured out, but wastes time.  I have the Forrest WWII as my main blade, which has now set my standard for blades... even with it's high cost, it ends up being well worth it in the long run..  I would not recommend this Freud dado setup for a profesional result, and look forward to buying the Forrest dado set. The best solution to this Freud dado stack setup is to take an hour or two and cut all the dado combinations on to one piece of wood.  That way you have this stick to test all of your pieces and quickly the proper stack setup for your project.  It is cheap though, so if that gets you cutting dado's, get it!\n\nI did find much more correct dado stack setups at the Freud site.  The chart I recieved with my purchase did not have the same information, so they must have figured this out and revised it online. I hope this one IS correct. [...]\n\nHappy wood working!\nAnswer:",

Surprisingly, this case is better designed for a Nook for two reasons:\n\n>>The sleep/power button location. On the Nook, the button is on the top center so none of the four corner holds block any button or access port. However, on the Kindle the button - which requires a slide, not a press - is towards the left of the device top and is covered slightly by the top left corner hold. This isn't a deal breaker for me, but I was very surprised at it because its being marketed for the Kindle! So when I want to wake up my Kindle I have to move the corner hold, slide the switch, and then readjust the corner hold. Not easy to do because the hold has a lot of (good) tension.\n\n>>5 way directional key. The notebooks that are included with this case slide into the case from the top and still have room to move both left and right. Because of the lining of the case and the thin cover of the notebook, it slides easily but I've never had it come out. I have however had it slide far right inside the cover, and then when I shut the cover it's at such a position that it hits the 5 way directional key and starts to advance chapters! I thought it was just a fluke at first, but then it kept happening. If I do not adjust the position of the notebook or force the Kindle into sleep then the notebook hits the key every time now. The Nook lacks this 5 way directional key entirely, so again - no issues there. (This issue might also be contributed to the \"breaking in\" of the case so that the spine is not rigid anymore and allows the front to move at angles. I don't believe I've been rough with the case though, so I can only assume its common wear).\n\nI also want to through my hat into the ring in regards to the less than compact design - though in truth I don't think it could have been any slimmer without causing negative pressure to the devices when closed.\nAnswer:",

On August 28th I emailed Fiskars as one question I had that was becoming very difficult to answer on my own was whether a rivet/pin that one of the pictures uploaded by a user tries to show.  Had a coworker that said no matter how indestructible an ax is said to be, if it is two-piece the head will eventually fly off.  I wanted something 14-20\", good for cutting down wood while camping, but something that would both work and last a reasonable amount of time.  Today I got an email from them, the 10th, and I will put what was \"questioned\" and what answer I got:\n\nMy email:\n\nhttp://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-media/permalink/mo16KN9E7G3CCZH/B0002YTO7E\n\nThis picture shows that a rivet/pin is used to strongly keep the head and handle together. I just want to verify this as I could not find any mention of this on the site for the X7s and the X11s.\n\nTheir response:\n\nThank you for contacting Fiskars.  The axes were not developed to be used as a hammer/mallet etc and do not recommend the tool to be used as such.  We include a warning with similar information on all of the axes.\n\nAs evident, their customer service does not seem to understand that not all questions need end with a question mark.  They also responded blindly answering some question that was never asked.  My interest never was in using it as a hammer/mallet, but to use it for what it is meant to be, cut wood. Now I understand that they CS is not run by idiots, but ultimately they are run by people that along with responding incredibly belatedly, they also responded with a scripted message that did not answer my question.\n\nAs such I give the hatchet 2 stars.  I did buy it, because it was a good price. It has worked fine so far even though the edge does show signs of faster wear than a 32\" ax I have laying around.  So far I haven't taken it camping, but mostly cutting down small wood to make fires in my backyard. Feels very light, but I'm not too sure whether the head will hold on well.  The whole entire handle is hollow. The best way I can describe is as if you got an empty role of paper towels and cut out a slot for an ax/hatchet head on one end and just slid it in and the compressed it into a dip in the head.  I have tried looking with a flash light, but it is near impossibly to look in it as the angle the light needs to be at to shine all the way to the end is also the angle I need to put my eye at to look in and well, can't do both.\n\nAs my review subject says, it's an ax, and if you keep it around the house or use it for menial tasks I can see it lasting a lifetime, but in a heat of the moment situation, I'd still have to test it. And that bring up another point, pointed out in another review, it is plastic so keep it away from heat.  Sharpening it is easy, but as anyone that has the slightest knowledge of metallurgy will tell you, easy to sharpen means it does not keep an edge well.  I do think that the angle of the edge helps spread out the impact of cutting across the head so the edge doesn't absorb it all and dull out quicker, but that is at the cost of having to provide more swing power to it. I am 210lb 6' tall and I workout and run extensively so for me that is no problem with a 14\" hatchet, I made got business of 1' thick pieces of wood, but I question whether others will have such an easy time or not. If you want to stay on something light, maybe the 17\" fiskars or a single-piece with a harder steel might do.\n\nAlso, last point, physics says that force=Mass*acceleration.  As such, don't believe that lighter or heavier axes are better or worse, they are the same thing.  In this case you are reducing the weight, which reduces fatigue, and increases acceleration(makes sense with the lighter weight), but you are well reducing the weight so the force is kept equal as that of heavier weight, less acceleration.  The main difference between a one or two-piece is the delivery of the blow.  In a two piece, the center of gravity is at the head, so you it is much more efficient at delivering the cutting blow.  In a one-piece two things are routinely done.  One if they keep the profile of the ax the same, the center of gravity is more along the center of the whole length of the axe so the force delivered is not as much as that generated; anyone who's used a one piece knows the feeling of your hands/arms wanting to keep going through the cut.  One way manufacturers circumvent this is by thinning out the profile of the handle, but that greatly weakens the head/handle joint, especially so in harder steel axes; they won't bend, just snap.\n\nJust some .02\nAnswer:",

The first day I met this thing I opened it up and wondered \"Where are the beans supposed to go?\".  It's small.  We have to grind two batches of french roast beans to get a decent 12 pot cup brew from this thing.  Having ground the first batch, I lifted the grinder and started to move it towards the filter...  and it was YANKED out of my hands by the combination of the amazingly short cord and the awful exterior design. I'm sure there is a reason for the comma-shaped cross section - but my hands just do NOT fit nicely around it.  I'm a big guy,  but my hands just do NOT fit around this thing.  Maybe it's designed for blacksmiths or Victorian Age pickpockets...  but it doesn't fit in MY hands.\n\nSo, after I flung coffee grounds all over the coffee room I got to spend the next 5 minutes playing with Mr Broom and Miss Dust Buster.  The next 10 minutes were spent carrying the thing to the electronics engineering department and getting the guy to extend the power cord by 2 feet.\n\nSo,  what have we got ?  We've got something that is hard to hold,  has an abysmally short cord,  and doesn't grind enough coffee for a 12 cup pot.  I think it might be perfect for a trendy kitchen in a Noo Yawk flat with silver and black accessories,  but it's not a robust tool for an office.\n\nPretty,  but hard to use.\nAnswer:",

This model is not even a D.I.Y. tool, the best thing I did is save the reciept and the box for returning every couple of months, use two blades up and replace the  brushes, use six blades and it won't cut more than one stud or one piece of  3/4\" conduit. Time to return/exchange for the next one, and repeat.  To the defense of Dewalt is that several other manufacturers have been the  same and several of those were made for each other, change the color and  decal. Poor work clamping and miter adjustments of any accuracy are not  able to be done. This works fine if you want to cut a brick or two and a  stud once in a while, steel over 1/8 inch is a load and results in  brush/motor failure.  You wonder why I own several, purely price. Save a  little longer and buy a portable band saw and later a stand for it and  enjoy.\nAnswer:",

This headset is used primarily for voice recognition dictation with Nuance Naturally Speaking 9.0.  First, I was put off by the very long cord and the large audio processing unit on it. Then, I felt the folding headset to be pretty rinky dink and too fragile for traveling. But, I rationalized that surely the digital enhancement would greatly improve the voice recognition leading to reduced typing errors and justifying this purchase. After several months of retraining the software to the new device, I returned to using the \"el cheapo\" headset I initially received from Nuance, which produces far fewer typing errors.\nAnswer:",

I got them for Christmas after doing a fair amount of researching and decided that, for the money, these would work fine.  I was also impressed by what people said about JLab's customer service.  When I listened to the first pair, I noticed that the right earphone would cut out to roughly 25% of the volume.  As I would adjust it, the sound would return so I started the process of burning them in.  They actually burned in pretty well and I enjoyed the sound, but the cutting out was still bugging me so I wrote to JLab about it.  They told me to send my old pair in and they would send me a new pair and, much to their credit, they sent me a pair right away.\n\nThe second pair was immediately worse than the first.  This pair cuts out in both ears and there is a crackle like a metal membrane being flexed.  Their response was that they couldn't get the first pair to recreate the problem I was describing so I thought that it might just be me.  It feels like the back-pressure is causing the problems so until it's seated just right I don't really get any decent sound.  Resting them lightly breaks the seal which kills any bass.  (These have never really seemed to burn in as well as the first pair either.)  I responded with a request for any kind of recommendation which was answered with the question of whether these problems occur without the silicon pads.  Since the pads created the seal and the pressure it doesn't so that didn't really help me.  My third email has remained unanswered and I'm just tired of dealing with it so I'll keep them and they can be the pair I sometimes listen to.\n\nI have determined that the issue isn't entirely me since I just bought a similar pair by another company that ended up costing less than half the price and they have none of the issues I just mentioned.  In fact, aside from their lack of a really clear mid-range right now, they sound just as good as the J3s.  Overall, the correspondance with J3 was very pleasant, just lacking in the end.  I just wish they could help me figure the problems out so I could be happy with them.\n\nOverall they do sound good pretty good.  This pair lacks a little of the bass and is a bit strong in the high range, but it's a good, clean sound which I appreciate for vocal music.  The size is good and the case is nice.  (I also ended up buying their Samba case for my iPod Touch.  It zips backward and seems upside down but works really well for what I wanted it for.)  The cord is a little short, but most of the time it doesn't both me.  Cord noise is a problem, but I'm usually sitting still when using them.  Ultimately they're a decent headphone that I think I've had really bad luck with.  The company seems willing to stand by their product...to a point.\nAnswer:",

I have gone through two of these in the last 5 years. My first one lasted just about 3 years and the second for only 1 year and 8 months. There is a common problem with both of them and their failure. Both ceased to function the brewing and hot plate staying cold. I did have positive dealings with Cusinart and they will honor the warranty, but I have a problem with their wanting $10 for shipping the replacement and wanting you to return the defective unit plus the return shipping charges.\nAfter the failure of the second maker, I decided to read reviews and about problems by other owners on additional sites . I found out that virtually all one star ratings, and there were several hundred, had a fire or possible fire related experience. In my case, while I did not have the fire issue, the problem was an indicator that there may well have been. The warming plate showed overheating or discoloration along the inside of the warming plate and the carafe had, what appeared to be baked coffee or burnt along the edge of the bottom.\n\nThis is a great drip automatic coffee maker with a good looking appearance, all the features that one may want. I enjoyed this maker, while they worked, but no longer have confidence in the reliability, especially after reading the fire related issues. I was fortunate not to have had a possible fire. I am returning the replacement from Cusinart because I simply don't trust it and instead, look for another brand.\nAnswer:",

The default software is not compatible with many would-be useful formats such as txt or rtf. There is no folder view for displaying the books you put on it, you are constrained to a library view that tries to sort everything for you. The settings page is a joke, there is almost no customization to be had there. The shop's main view was nonfunctional out of the box; every time I tried to access it, it kicked me back out to the main page, and I had to access it by going to the \"top 100\" page instead, and even then the search would sometimes not work. The battery capacity went down 20% over 4 days, so I don't think that it would make the 2 month mark that it should have.\n\nFor all of it's failings, it gets much better once it is rooted, as underneath it all, it is still an android 2.1 device. Once that happens, you have access to the android market, email, web browser, and more importantly, you can get apps that are better than the default nook book reader. You can even put amazon's android kindle reader on it as well.\n\nThe reason for the relatively low rating is that all of these features and functionality should have been unlocked by default. The default software that comes with it feels unfinished and lacking in features to me, and it seems like B&N were just being lazy when putting it together. Rooting it is also a pain, and even though there are some rough edges in a fully unlocked android OS on an eink interface, I still think that it is better than the default software.

It's compact, heats up quickly, and has a lid that allows you to save oil.  These aspects make it perfect for frying regularly in small households.  However, I can't give it a perfect five stars because when using it for multiple applications - frying wontons, plantain chips, etc. - the oil temperature fluctuated far too widely.  I'm used to the fact that the oil temperature sometimes drops when a lot of food is added to your cooking vessel.  With this deep fryer my problem was the opposite - even when making regular batches of food the oil temperature regularly got too high according to my deep frying thermometer, rather than staying in an optimal 350 to 375 range.  Once the temperature gets too high I found it quite hard to bring the temperature back down other then unplugging it for intervals or adding more food.  But I expect if a deep fryer doesn't offer any temperature settings or a visible built in thermometer, that it will be at least pretty consistent in temperature.  For me, the fact that I can't control the temperature also limits its usefulness because I can't, for example, use it when making French fries that first call for frying the potatoes at 325 degrees followed by 375 degrees.\n\nSadly, with the issues mentioned above this seemed like more of a hassle than simply frying with my Dutch oven over the stove.  With that combined with my deep fry thermometer I find that I have much more control over frying both in terms of choosing the frying temperature I want and maintaining an even cooking temperature.  I find adjusting the burners much easier as a way of maintaining oil temperature than I did find using this deep fryer.\n\nI think, unfortunately, this model sacrifices some very needed features for affordability and for me, it limits its usefulness.\nAnswer:",

All in all it is a decent machine but there are several things I DONT like about it.\n\n1. VERY noisy\n2. The base of the glass blending carafe is very wide, so when blending thick smoothies or purees,  the blade ends up spinning rapidly but does not really get things mixed well. I have to stop the blend and use a spoon to get the edges going again.\n3. Also a BIG problem with the glass blending carafe is that the threads go the same direction as the blades. So when the machine is working hard, like on a smoothie or puree, it actually begins to unscrew from the collar and base. So I have to hold it in place. This seems like a design flaw and is very dangerous is someone isn't paying attention to their machine. When I called Cuisinart about the issue, they said the the only 8 month old machine was out of warranty so they could not replace collar, which they thought might have been stripped. Problem with that explanation is that it has been doing this from the beginning.\nAnswer:",

Phillips has changed its warranty policy from 1 year parts & labor to 1 year parts 90 days labor.  Does this tell you they have learned something?\n\nThis unit worked fine at first but after about 6 mos. began to exhibit reading problems.  It doesn't like +R discs.  +RW discs are just fine but my experience is after a while it refuses to read the +R discs it has just recorded.\n\nAfter 2 software upgrades from Philips which gave me added features but failed to solve my problem, I had to ship it to City of Industry, CA as Philips no longer maintains its own repair facility.  Fortunately the unit was under warranty and I only had to pay for shipping to L.A.  Returned repaired  after 2 mos. and worked fine for 4 months until same problem recurred.  Cannot record to +R disc without encountering \"disc error\", \"disc empty\" (just recorded on disc), or \"disc contains unknown data\".  Sometimes the content on the disc can be saved and finalized and sometimes not.  I am going to have to buy another +R/+RW unit as I have about 200 blank discs.  The same problem recurred, meaning the part they replaced also went defective after a short time meaning the design of this particular part is flawed.  There is no use repairing again as the part that replaces defective unit is itself defective.  DESIGN FLAW.  Possibly newer models have overcome this problem, one can only hope.

Its better in packed powder and somewhat steerable - you will need to use arms or legs in the snow to get the best control.  On icy hard pack conditions this can be very hard to control.\nMy biggest negative is the build quality.  The varnish/stain is cheaply done and inconsistent in application as well as did not seem to be very thick - came off after a few runs.  The very thin nylon rope broke 3 times and we kept having to double knot it over and over.  The chain that holds the curved part of the wood and provides tension is attached with this circle ring.  The circle ring is not completely closed so the rope would slide through and we even had the chain come off.  The absolute worst part is that the boards seem very thin.  So thin in fact that we actually cracked two boards on some gentle riding with the family!!!  As a kid I remember punishing our toboggan but never saw it break.  This was a surprise and a big negative after only a few weeks of use.  Looking at the bottom of the sled, nearly all of the varnish is now gone and it now needs a good wax before sledding to reduce the drag.

His ears are still too small for most earbuds, and several older cheap pairs of headphones around the house were only halfway working.  I wanted him to have something decent that would block out ambient outside noise, and be comfortable for him to wear around the house or in the car.  These headphones have fit those requirements at their core... great sound quality (when working) and quite comfortable with effective blocking of most regular-volume ambient noise.  Not bad for $15, except for the nearly immediate problem I experienced that invalidates all the positive features...\n\n(Side note: As others have mentioned, these headphones have a LONG cord compared to many other consumer-level headphones.  It's a decent feature I suppose for studio-type use, but often gets in the way when the mp3 player / phone / computer / other device is nearby, like in your lap or pocket.  The long cord hangs down/around and must be tucked or rolled up some other way.  This doesn't relate to my star rating, but a \"feature\" that might be overlooked otherwise.)\n\nA week after Christmas, I was \"testing out\" the headphone (as parents often do with their kids' electronic goodies) and noticed the sound was cutting out a bit.  I could fiddle with the cord connection to my laptop, and sound would return.  At the time, I blamed this on my laptop... it is an older computer and I figured the headphone input was loose in some way.  I should have tested more.\n\nNow three weeks after Christmas, my son informed me the other day (after using the headphones after a long car ride) that he had to twist/spin/manipulate the headphone cord connector to get any sound at all.  I tested extensively and unfortunately found this to be true.  It is apparent that the internal connections, probably in the form of solder joints within the connector, are weak and failing after three weeks of very light use.\n\nUsually the \"early bird gets the worm\" but in this case, ordering these headphone 2 months before Christmas hurt me.  I'm beyond the Amazon return window, and I'm still reading the fine print but I believe the Koss warranty is 90 days from purchase... so it's gone too.  Even if they would cover a warranty repair, YOU pay to ship them out and Koss requires a $9.00 payment to cover their return shipping.  Obviously by then I can just buy a brand new pair.  However, I don't plan to do that for a product that is cheaply manufactured to the point that it is defective soon after arrival.\n\nThe only silver lining here is that I found a lot of helpful Youtube videos on replacing the headphone connection, rather than throwing the headphones out.  I should be able to complete this repair for under $5 with a new connector and a soldering iron (which I already own but will need some practice using).  Still, I didn't expect to need to spend more money and time to make these nearly new headphones work properly.\n\nYours may be fine, but be aware of this potential problem.  This would have been a 4-4.5 star rating, if not for the cheap connection that reduced it to a useless, but fixable, 2-star product.\nAnswer:",

It worked just fabulously, and we could not rave enough about it - until this morning after about two months - when DeLonghi suddenly lost some vital parts during breakfast preparation.  That was not a good way to start the day. I called the DeLonghi service line to find out what to do with the diseased member of their family, while staring at my uncooked bacon.  I punched my way through a maze of useless automated telephone response options - finally after half an hour on the line,  I got a rather unfriendly and unresponsive customer service agent who advised me to contact the nearest service center, which is 27 miles from home (one way).  This meant driving 54 miles to bring the thing there and 54 miles to pick it up - or two half day excursions to the Los Angeles area, braving L.A. traffic. After learning that it would take between four and six weeks to fix my DeLonghi  (there must be a lot of DeLonghis giving up the ghost prematurely),  I called Amazon to the rescue.  My concerns were handled professionally and  responsively by a friendly AMAZON customer agent (the DeLonghis could learn from them). AMAZON is sending  a prepaid UPS return label and the DeLonghi goes back where it came from - full refund minus restocking charges - much better than wasting two half days in traffic.  Impressed and reassured by this AMAZON performance,I ordered a new one as our family cannot live without a toaster oven.  However DeLonghi is passe, so we're going with a Cuisinart with a standard 3 year warranty. Thank you AMAZON, you are a great dot-com !\nAnswer:",

Some of the blades take some real jamming to fit onto the attachment and are difficult to remove.  The cheese came out grated fairly finely, but in groups of 4-5 attached strands matching the shape of the blades rather than individual gratings.  Pepperoni from the fridge that I tried to slice just came out mashed.  Both left large half cm rectangles of un-grated or sliced food between the blade and the plastic.  I'm deciding whether to return this or try it one more time on veggies since it was reasonably inexpensive.  If I had to grate 5lbs of cheese and not just 8oz at a time then it would be worth it.  Maybe a mini-slicer/shredder would work significantly better?  I can't see a great reason for this being so large as anything you were cutting could be squared down to size, and then surely the spaces in the equipment could be smaller.  I can see that if the blader were sharper they would be potentially hazardous to clean, and perhaps not last as long, but as they are they do not perform the expected tasks adequately.  Again reducing the size might help with this problem.\nAlso combining all their attachments into a single review is a dirty trick.  I'm sure this would not have a 4.5 star rating on its own.  The rating on their website, now that I check it, is terrible.  False advertising.\nAnswer:",

It must go on a network if we are to go broadband.\n\nPurchased this because it was advertised to work with \"WIN98\" and supposed to work on a 220MHz CPU with 64meg of RAM.\n\nFirst problem.  It is WIN98SE that it is supposed to work on.  It doesn't work on pre-SE.  With pre-se the device showed a yellow ! that can't be fixed.\n\nSo upgraded machine to WIN98SE.  Driver loaded and everything looked fine.\n\nThe monitoring program said adapter was active.  Great.\n\nWell not so great.  WIN98SE won't start up with the adapter attached without generating a \"WINDOWS PROTECTION ERROR: you need to restart your machine.\"  It also scrambled the LCD display so that the computer didn't know what kind of display device we had when starting up in the SAFE mode.\n\nIf the device was left unplugged the machine starts up normally.  One can then plug in the adapter and it works.  That is useless!\n\nSeveral phone calls to LinkSys were made.  First suggestion: Plug the device in after startup. The got the message that that was not a solution.  Second suggestion try on another machine.\n\nI have another WIN98SE machine with .5GB memory and 2GHz Celeron.  The adapter worked normally on it.  No problems\n\nSo the problem is either one peculiar to the IBM ThinkPad 600 or it is under RAMed and/or under CPU'd for the task. Who really knows what goes on at boot up.\n\nThe last suggestion from LinkSys was to go to their website and download about 500Meg of an older driver/program and try that.  Guys, we have dialup.  No way!  They did confirm I was using the latest and recommended driver for V4 hardware.\n\nThis plus an announcement on the phone line about updating the router driver for the router I just ordered from LinkSys has soured me.\n\nWant all computers here to use same adapters.  So this one is out of the running.  LinkSys did make a good faith effort to solve this one.  They were easy to reach and took a lot of time to try and solve this.  Unfortunately, only the god's know what is happening....\nAnswer:",

I have 3 main problems with the camera. #1- The Zoom. 2x zoom is just about like having no zoom at all. Forget the 2.5 digital zoom, it makes the pictures too fuzzy. #2- It has problems in low- light situations. I often have to use photo editing software to brighten up pictures. #3- The display is not very clear.\nFor the same amount of money, I wish I had gone with the Fuji Finepix 2800. It has the 6x optical zoom with a much clearer display.\nWith that said, it is a very small camera. Slip it in your pocket and no one has to know that you're a tourist. Also, the video with sound is very cool. With a 128 MB card and up you can store many video clips (up to 60 seconds per clip depending on what you're filming. Complex backgrounds such as trees will eat up the time quicker then if you were videoing sky). Also the software that comes with the Canon is very easy to use and the video software is neat too. I've heard people complain about the battery life but I took a whole weekend of videos and pictures with the display on without having to charge it.\nSo it boils down to: if you're looking for the small size, go with the Canon. If you're looking for zoom in the same price range as the Canon, go with the Finepix 2800.\nAnswer:",

The kids went undefeated during their pre-season and regular season and even played in a league tournament and won so more so we felt that these gifts would be perfect to show them that all their hard work and effort paid off because they got something that they all didn't have before.\n\nI received 5 scooter on a Friday then the other 10 on that following Monday.  Majority of the boxes were beat up pretty bad.  There was 1 of the 15 that came ripped on both sides with parts exposed and it looked as if someone had opened and returned the scooter because it was taped with clear tape all around the top which the other did not have.  I tried to get in contact with someone but that was a headache so we just assembled that scooter to check and make sure all the parts were in the box because we didn't want to have to send it back and wait for another one.\n\nThe set up was really quick and easy which we loved because there aren't many parts to assemble. Although the charging of the battery is quite long it was really easy to just plug in and watch the light turn green which was great.\n\nMy son took a few days before he tried it out and when he finally did he was riding it for about 20 minutes then he fell.  It was a pretty hard fall because I could hear it from my home when he fell 2 doors down.  I ran outside and he was screaming that his foot was sore.  I got him into the house and a few hours later he was still complaining about his foot so I took him to the ER.  They said he fractured 2-3 bones in his foot.  So he got a splint and crutches until we followed up with a Pediatric Orthopedic.  We went the next day and he said that my son fractured 4 bones, only the baby toe wasn't fractured.  He didn't get a cast but he did get a boot which he will be wearing for 2 weeks then the doc will be checking him again to see what will be done from there.  I need to ice his foot 5 times a day everyday so that the swelling in his foot will go down.  My son wasn't wearing a helmet at the time and the doc told us that this type of injury is seen usually from people who are going at high speeds so we're lucky that he didn't hit his head because he would have been in the ICU.\n\nWe are really thankful that it was just his foot but now I am rethinking if these gifts are good to give to 4-6 year old kids.  For me I will be thinking during these 2 weeks if I will give it back to my son because I need to really weigh the good and bad things associated with the scooter.\n\nSo just a friendly reminder REMEMBER TO MAKE YOUR KIDS WEAR THE HELMET!!!!\nAnswer:",

I did not want to spend a fortune on an item that I will only use seasonally. I figured since I already had a KitchenAid mixer that this would be a wise purchase. Once I used it, I had the same problem as most of the reviewers that I read in regards to the pulp strainer part getting clogged very often. I found that I would have to rinse it out after about 2-3 oranges. I ended up just taking that part out after a while which was also a pain because I had to go back and strain the seeds and pulp afterwards. The most awkward thing about this that I personally found was just the fact that when you use a normal juicer you are pushing downward on the fruit to juice it. With this juicer, you have to push forward to use it. I did not realize how strange this would be until I actually did it. I did not have any trouble with the juice running down my arm like some people that I read. I am still not quite sure what the best speed is on my mixer to get this juicer to work most efficiently. I went from a \"2\" to having it on full speed, and then back and forth, I felt like I could never get it quite right. I also felt that most of the juice getting squeezed out was more from the force that I had to push against the juicer than from the turning of the juicer actually helping to get the juice out.\nAll in all, I am happy that I purchased this product. I have already used it several times and it still works. Of course, the only reason that I purchased it was because I already had a KitchenAid mixer. I am definitely a fan of using what I already have instead of having another appliance lying around. I am sure that there are much better juicers out there but I don't think that you would find one for the same price that works as well.\nAnswer:",

I like the locking mechanism a lot. The clip grips my pocket well after 18 months of daily carry.\n\nI can get a good edge on it without too much effort with a Spyderco Tri-Angle, which is a good thing, because it needs to be resharpened after virtually every time I open it (and I don't abuse it -- no paper, for example). The only exception I've found is nicking a steak on the grill to see if it's cooked through. If you're careful, you can make a half inch cut in a piece of rare beef without destroying the edge. So that's nice.\n\nBut this knife really isn't made to be used for cutting things. If you're one of those people who gets a knife so he can use it to cut stuff, you'd be better served by a product intended for that particular niche.\n\nUPDATE: Just bought the same knife with a D2 blade. We'll see how it works. I went into Cabela's to look at the Benchmade North Fork, but it felt blocky and weird and looked funny. Good think I checked it out before ordering one. What I really wanted was either CPM-S30V or D2, so I was happy to go with the mini-Grip in D2. The guy at the knife counter thought my particularly bad experience with 154CM could be down to using it to cut tape on boxes and getting it gummed up with adhesive, so I may be unfairly condemning the 154CM. Well, the old one goes in my toolbox as a spare and we'll see how the D2 does. I'll try degumming it before I go to the sharpener. You can get the mini-Griptilian in S30V using Benchmade's \"Build Your Own Knife\" feature on their website, but it'll cost you 60+% more.\nAnswer:",

I was also looking at the Sensory Science Rave, but that one was not available anywhere, .... The Nomad MG was *very* similar in price and functionality.\nI required SmartMedia expandability because that's what I use with my Olympus digital camera. Smartmedia works well (including 128MB SmartMedia) for both functions, and I can have both music and photographs on the card at the same time -- using the card interchangably between the two devices.\nI love the small size -- it's about the size of a deck of cards -- and the fact that it comes with 64MB. With the 128MB smartmedia, I can get a total of 192MB on this device. The sound quality is great, it can record from FM radio (another nice feature) and it can record voice and play it back at different speeds (great for lectures!). Also, it came with high capacity NiMH batteries, which is a plus. Upgradable firmware is also a plus.\nIt has locked up on me a few times for no apparent reason. Once I had to take the batteries out and put them back in to get it to reset. However, this doesn't happen often enough to be too much of a bother.\nThe on-screen user interface needs some work -- for example, once a song finishes scrolling by, you can't go back and see the title of it without stopping the song and restarting it. This is frustrating when you have it in your pocket while listening, then want to see the song/artist that's currently playing.\nThe hardare interface leaves much to be desired, and is the reason for my 3-star rating. With a better hardware interface, this unit would easily receive 5 stars. The buttons are on the side, and it's difficult to remember which ones do what -- especially if you're just reaching into your backpack to change a song. Many buttons are multi-funciton, and to access some functions, you need to press a button for at least a second or two. You may find yourself running for the manual to figure out how to use some of the more obscure features.\nAlso, because there are buttons on both sides, if you hold the player in your hand both your thumb and some fingers will be resting on buttons -- press a button with your thumb and you might also press one on the other side as well. Also the \"delete\" button is placed right next to the \"Next\" button, although there is an \"are you sure?\" prompt. (There's also a \"lock\" switch that guards against accedental button-pushing.) Finally, the round stylish screen (though unique and actually higher resolution than normal) is very small -- I'd prefer a larger square screen, even if the resolution were lower.\nIf you want an very small SmartMedia-expandable player with excellent features and excellent sound, and can tolerate a poorly designed hardware interface (as I can) then this is the player for you. Buy it for its functionality, not its interface.\nI hope this helps you with your decision!!\np.s. The \"leather\" case is a joke. I don't think it's actually leather, but even if it were you might try it once but it'll quickly get tossed away -- see, I almost even forgot to mention it! No belt clip, poor accessibility, etc, it's rather useless, which is a shame, because the face and corners of this player will wear with use.\nAnswer:",

I bought mine for about $440 and the next lowest monitor with comparable specs was at least $150 more.\nI also want to give a shout out to all the reviewers/owners who answered my pre-purchase questions. Even the seller answered several questions before I placed my order. Thanks to them, I went in knowing EXACTLY what I was getting, and I think that is why I am so pleased with my purchase.\nThis is a great monitor if you set your expectations right.\n1. Thew monitor does not have any onboard/built-in graphics processor. It is a passive display. So ... make sure you have a compatible GPU in your machine. The list is available on the main product page. I have paired it with&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Sapphire-Radeon-HD6670-Ultimate-1GB-GDDR5-DVI-HDMI-DisplayPort-PCI-Express-Video-Card-100326UL/dp/B005LU2Z1G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Sapphire Radeon HD6670 Ultimate 1GB GDDR5 DVI/HDMI/DisplayPort PCI-Express Video Card 100326UL</a>&nbsp;which delivers a full 2560*1600 via DVI-D and DP (only 1920*1200 via HDMI). I read somewhere that the screen is an OEM LG product, and Yamakasi simply builds a frame around it. I can't confirm this.\n2. This monitor accepts only ONE type of input. DVI-D. Make sure you are delivering signal via DVI-D only. If you're coming out with DP, you'll need to buy a DP-to-DVI-D cable.\n3. The monitor has no bells and whistles. IT has an on/off toggle and a brightness adjuster. That's it. No speakers either.\n4. The monitor is HEAVY. The bezel around the screen and the profile thickness may not be appealing to some. I don't mind at all, because the display is so stunning, I don't even notice the fat bezel. There are no speakers.\n5. The aspect ratio is supposed to be 16:9, but for some unknown reason, the sticker in the top right corner claims it's 16:10. Just ignore.\n6. There is some backlight bleed.\n7. The monitor is VESA compatible. I don't have it mounted like that, but in case you wanted to.\n8. The instructions manual is practically useless, but you really don't need it. There is very slight assembly required when you first open the box. The monitor comes with a short DVI-D (male-male) cable. For my home office, I use a very long&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/BlueRigger-DVI-Male-to-DVI-Male-Digital-Dual-Link-Cable-25-Feet-Black/dp/B009WACR14/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">BlueRigger DVI Male to DVI Male Digital Dual-Link Cable (25 Feet, Black)</a>&nbsp;cable. I'm sure there's a bit of a signal loss, but for my purposes, it is impossible to notice or measure it.\n9. As far as I know, this monitor is not Energy Star rated. So you should develop a habit of turning off the display when not in use.\n10. Highly recommend that you spend the time and calibrate your display at http://www.lagom.nl/lcd-test/ unless you have a robust calibration software installed. Don't rely on Windows calibration alone.\n11. Related - the monitor does not ship with drivers or any screen-splitting software. You won't (most likely) need any drivers and Windows 8.1 native screen split is actually pretty good.\n12. Considering that this monitor was manufactured in S. Korea, is shipped from there, and the manual and box are printed in Korean, the \"Spartan Warrior\" theme is, quite frankly, just weird. I am unable to take it seriously.\n\nIn summary, if you do your research, ask the right questions BEFORE you buy, and set your expectations correctly, you will be very happy with this monitor. My use it to read/write emails, spend hours in very large Excel models, and keep an eye on Bloomberg screens. This mammoth display accommodates all that. The Excel use trumps everything else for me. To give you an idea: at 2560*1600 at Excel at 100% zoom, the max cell I can see is AE52. That is a LOT of Excel real estate. My average spreadsheet is 2 or 3 times that size and I think I would've gone nuts using a 1080 display.\nI have not noticed any flicker or waver while in use. I have sometimes noticed some flicker when the CPU is being powered down.\nIf you're a real person, and not a gamer, this might be the right choice for you.\n\nAdded bonus: the massive box doubles as a \"dog and cat barrier\"\n\nUpdate July 2015\nI still love the display qualities of this monitor, and I haven't noticed a single dead pixel.\nBut...\nThe power supply died after three months of use. This is a big deal because:\n1. There is quite literally NO ONE standing behind this product. I sent an email to the seller (with no real hope), they responded with some nonsensical reply (English translation: Go pound sand!).\n2. A replacement power supply costs a minimum of $90.

This Grundig's two best design features are its Porsche-designed cosmetics and its handy leather carrying \"case.\" These things alone are cool enough to inspire almost any shortwave listener to want one and have fun using it.\nThe radio's performance isn't quite as great as its beauty, however. For its small size, it performs fine with an external antenna, but less well with the aerial. Its sensitivity is decent, and selectivity is passable. But don't expect a listening experience on par with rivals within its price class ($100-$150). Bottom line is, you're paying more for the looks than anything else. If performance is what you desire, keep looking.\nI give it less than four stars for several reasons. First, it fails to cover the entire shortwave spectrum from 1600 khz to 30 mhz. That's a big drawback among today's digital radios. Second, the keypad is awkward to use, even though it looks fabulous. Third, the software provides a measly 10 memory positions for shortwave, which is okay if you only listen to the major broadcasters.\nNevertheless, the G2000A is an aesthetically nice radio that's fun to operate for casual listening. For a novice listener, I'd recommend something simpler. If you're a more serious, demanding listener, you probably already have something else. I enjoy using it because it reminds me of my dad's old Zenith Royal 500E, which has a great leather case. I like this Grundig, but I'm glad it isn't my only one.\nAnswer:",

I do field service work and to have everything laid out in order every time i go to a site is nice and efficient. most everything else is in pouches and takes a little digging to find the right tool.

So when i bought this for my second rollup for the tools I use \"second\" most I expected some of the same great features but this didn't come through.\n\nThe straps need to be unthreaded then rethreaded each time you open or close the case. quick clips are so much more efficient.\n\nThe socket pouches are just pouches. i have some things I could put in there but was planning on this for sockets.\nthe fabric seems ok but I am giving this to my retired father so I won't get any use out of it.\n\nAgain the roll up seems ok. just could be more efficiently designed for opening and closing.

There's no comparison.  The Krups made absolutely perfect coffee.  This Cuisinart is curious.  The coffee it makes is smooth & dark, but there's a distinct lack of taste - no burnt pencil or dirty sock flavor like a Mr. Coffee makes, no objectional flavors at all, but a general lack of flavor.  So I've doubled the amount of grounds that I would have used in my Krups & while there's definitely more flavor (as well as a powerful hit of caffeine - whoa mama, peel me off the ceiling!), my wife & I both made the same comment - it doesn't taste like coffee.  I know that may not make sense, but that's our first impression.  We've tried making about 15 different runs using the 1-4 setting, normal setting, more grounds, less grounds, more water, less water. We're kinda frustrated.  I'm going to continue making adjustments & give this machine as much of a chance as I can before I return it.  I'll give a final update at a later date.\n\nWe've had this coffee maker for 3 days and decided to return it.  Not one pot of decent coffee.  Too bad.\nOutput:",

I have  a vast collection of radios and many many years of radio listening and purchasing experience  I can do accurate compares which many find helpful. When I purchased this radio I so wanted it to be great like the old days of Grundig . Its not bad , but I wouldn't go out of my way to reccommend it over others . The Sony sw7600gr and the Sangean ATS909 are much better buys . Here's why , first off the Grundig YB400pe is generally not made very well . The poor quality of the body , the antenna and the sound are obvious upon first look and listen . The tuner sensativity on FM is good but AM and SW are fair . The side band set up is ok , others are better . One draw back is that it takes 6 AA batteries while the others take 4 .This makes the radio very heavy for its size . True that the Sangean 909 and the Sony 7600 are a little more expensive but worth it . You are getting a more durable radio with a much better tuner and better sound . So I guess to sum it up its not that this radio is so bad its that the others in its class are so good.\nOutput:",

Some of the distance are questionable because when I shoot a flag, it gives out 20 yards more then what it posted at the driving range.

Also at night, it's very hard or impossible to get a reading unless the object you're shooting is white.\n\nCon: Flimsy, almost toy type construction.  Not so good in dim lighting.  Need to have a big target and steady hands to operate it correctly.  May need to measure different targets to ensure you're getting the correct distance.\n\nPro: Light weight if you're carrying it on your waist belt and walking 18 holes.

I found this Stylus Reach and thought it would be good for bore inspections and other detail work. For a $17 light, it's not bad. Just okay...\n\nThe light is well-made. I've used mine for all sorts of dirty things and it holds up just fine. The pocket clip is a bit cheap, as it slides up and down the light instead of staying in place. This gets worse after a while, as the anodizing wears off and the clip loosens up. You can remove it, tighten it a bit, then re-install, sure. A glare guard is included, which is simply a piece of soft plastic that slides over the bulb end of the Stylus. It has a hole in it, and this allows you to guide the beam a bit more. In all honesty, it barely works for that, and I keep mine installed just to not scratch up the LED. The light runs on two AAAA batteries, and two Energizers are included. You're going to get about 65 hours out of a pair, and the batteries sell for about a dollar each when it's time to get more.\n\nThe Stylus uses a 5mm LED and puts out around 10 lumens, and the beam is the typical blue-ish blob found in so many 5mm LEDs. The tailcap doesn't do anything for me: press the soft button for momentary on, or tighten for constant on. I greatly prefer a clicky switch, but I understand it may not be possible at this price and small diameter. It is 9\" long, so that's a bad thing for me. That takes up a lot of space for a penlight. The LED is mounted on a 7\" long flexible steel cable, and is good for peering into the bores of guns or other around-the-corner work. I had a Stylus Reach in my EOD kit in the military, and it worked just fine.\n\nFor the money, I don't think the Stylus Reach is a good value. If it were closer to the $13 range, it would be good. The long size, rare (and expensive) battery, and weird tailcap make me want to carry something else.\nOutput:",

I did not purchase mine from Amazon. The first unit I got barely put out 1 watt from the small antenna. I sent it back to Midland under warranty, and they sent me a new one. The new one puts out 3 watts from the small antenna port (acceptable, but I wish it was 4 watts)\n\nPro: Nice small unit that can be used as a portable CB/Walkie-Talkie or in a vehicle with the mobile adapter which has an external power source (cigarette lighter) and external antenna connector.\nWhen using an external antenna, this unit works as good as any other modern budget Chinese made CB radio with the same features. I do not think it is as good as the Japanese CB radios from the 1970's and 1980's.\nThe main unit (head) can be removed when used in a vehicle, so it doesn't get stolen.\nIt comes with two battery packs. One for use with regular (Alkaline; Lithium) batteries, and one for use with rechargeable batteries. The rechargeable battery pack will recharge the batteries with the enclosed AC adapter.\nHas weather channels.\n\nCons: The small antenna and battery pack has very limited range, and is only good for use around a campsite. I doubt it will broadcast past 100 yards in wide open spaces with the small antenna.\nThe transmit button is next to the channel change buttons. Once in a while you may accidentally change channels when you think you are pushing the transmit button.\nThe mobile adapter has the coax and power cord wound in a coil. Winding a coax cable into a coil creates a choke which may alter SWR and power output. When you pull on the unit the wound coil changes shape, so the choke will also change. Cobra makes a similar unit that doesn't have a coiled section.\nThe rubber plug that covers the MIC and SPK ports breaks off easily. You will lose it eventually.\nThe cigarette lighter plug doesn't stay firmly in any of my GM trucks 3 lighter sockets. If you pull too much on the unit when you bring it to your mouth to talk, the plug sometimes comes out, and the unit shuts off. This is annoying.\n\n.\nOutput:",

That sparked my wanting to buy one for my son.  I looked and looked for the ones with the sheet attached and this was the ONLY one I could find that had it so I went ahead and purchased. Overall, it's exactly the same as the one I had as a child.  HOWEVER there is one flaw in this tent that caused us to use it only once and I haven't put it back up again.

Disappointing because he loved it. I wish I could return it, but having bought through an amazon third party that is usually easier said than done.\nOutput:",

I use this one more for light grilling a sandwich, whereas I've used the smaller one more to actually cook meat on. As another reviewer states, it takes quite a long time to cook something like a chicken breast or a steak. It does turn out good but as also stated, it caused a lot of smoke as well. Thats because the bottom of the grill gets all the juices and they burn while the meat slowly cooks. Since the grill edges are so high and wide, I don't believe it gets enough heat (unlike a fire grill). I also don't go over medium setting. The other annoying thing with this is how difficult it is to clean. Plan to spend time with a brush. It is not non-stick at all. I would rather use my old cast iron skillet to cook meat on, and use these for more regular cooking or light grilling. So for the price, I can't really recommend this skillet. I do love Le Creuset's porcelain enameled cookware however. That is the best.\nOutput:",

It has worked well all this time, but my wife was looking under the sink and discovered some yukky water spots on the floor of the cabinet.  Further inspection showed a buildup of dried water/scuzz on the side of the disposal.  Cleaned and scraped off the scuzz and revealed a crack in the plastic casing.  I probably could repair the crack with silicon glue, but after reading other reviews mentioning cracked cases, I think it's time to replace, not fix.

Was looking for a set of good quality over-the-ear noise-reducing headphones that I could wear at work and travel -- ones I didn't have to spend an arm and a leg for.\n\nThese definitely deliver in terms of the quality -- I'm no audiophile, but listen to a broad range of music and music styles, and find these headphones to deliver consistent quality sound with great clarity in all ranges.\n\nDespite not being true noise-cancelling headphones (they do not employ Active Noise Control or other similar destructive interference technology) they are very good at muffling out ambient noise -- while noise doesn't completely disappear, they do effectively block the loud chatter that goes on around me at work -- the primary reason I got these headphones.\n\nSome drawbacks:\n\nLike others, I initially thought that these would truly be \"over-the-ear\" -- they rest on TOP of your ears, however, and do cause your ears to get warm over extended periods of use, but not excessively so. Despite this, I found that they provided very good comfort, even over hours of use, and I did not experience pain from fit as others might have. The ear pad portions are slightly adjustable, which helps.\n\nNB: These headphones did NOT come with a wind-up belt-clip as advertised on the detail page. The cords are very long, which is convenient, but could definitely use the further convenience of a self-retracting or wind-up belt-clip for travel use.\n\nOtherwise, am so far very pleased with the great quality these deliver without a high ticket price. A great set of headphones for a very reasonable price.\nOutput:",

With only one exception, it has worked very well on the all of the DVD rentals and titles I have bought. At first, I did experience the variations of light and dark picture (especially on \"Meet the Parents\") that others have mentioned, but it went away when I connected it directly to the television, and not through the VCR.  The sound is very good, if not great.\nOne problem I have had, that I haven't seen mentioned elsewhere, is that the player defaults to a French soundtrack (if that option is available on the menu) if you do not actually select English before starting the movie. This is more an annoyance than a major problem, since I knew it was an inexpensive machine going in and expected some bugs. But one movie I bought, John Boorman's \"Excalibur,\" will NOT play in English no matter what. In fact, after a few minutes of trying, you cannot even access the menu on this DVD. This is the only title so far that has had this problem - the disc worked fine on a friend's machine, so I know it's not the DVD. I have not tried the Disney discs that some others have had problems with.\nOther than this, I have been pleased with its operation, and have enjoyed many hours of viewing with no distractions from the player. I have been watching the \"Monty Python's Flying Circus\" complete series box set (which cost more than the player!) and have had no problems navigating through the many special features. I will probably get a more expensive machine in the future, but I think this was a great way to initially get into the world of DVD.\nOutput:",

We cannot always hear the local sirens in the house so we wanted something that would make some noise and wake us up, if necessary.\n\nThe battery life leaves a lot to be desired, but there is an a/c jack in the side of the unit.  Unfortunately, it's 7.5volts, which is a little hard to find these days.  I went to Radio Shack and bought an a/c adapter for about $20 and had to get one with a customizable voltage and a separate connection.  Just bring it into the store and they set one up for you.\n\n It's been very useful b/c the unit was programmed with the SAME codes and our power had gone off.  At least we knew we were under a severe thunderstorm warning along with a tornado watch.  Just having that information made it worth the $20 or so I'd paid for the unit.\n\nI would recommend also purchasing a TV radio with a weather radio since the NOAA announcements don't always give the path of the storm.  At least you can hear the local news tell you which towns are going to be hit next on the storm's path.\n\nBecause of the battery life and the cost of the a/c adapter, I'm considering purchasing the docking version of this to keep for another level of the house.

The big hole fitting works well on Mozzerella and Cheddar /Monterey Jack cheeses and the smaller hole graters work really well on harder cheeses such as Gran Padano, Gruyere or Parmeggano Reggiano (Parmesan).  So if you only want a cheese sandwich, or if you want to cook Pizza or Pasta or even a Swiss Fondue, you will halve the effort by using this grater.\nYou do have to cut the cheese into cubes before you grate it, and if you buy cheese in large pieces this can be a pain.\nHowever, for really hard things like whole nutmegs or brazil nuts, it is difficult to get a grip with the handle.  For those you tend to go back to the flat grater for small amounts or to a food processor if you need volume.  By the way, Brazil nuts make a great stuffing for mushrooms!\nAs to this grater - it cleans well in a dish washer, but is less easy to wash out by hand.  You need a bottle brush to clean the inner side of the drum.  I think this is the thing that puts most people off rotary graters.  But if you have a dish washer you will be OK.\nOutput:",

Do you really want to blow another heavy chunk of change for a basic, thread on UV filter?  Well, I would normally advise that you don't skimp on quality when it comes to filters.  After all, would you pay a premium price for a high performance automobile, only to fill it with watered down fuel?  I should nope not!  So is it such a bright idea to buy such a low cost UV filter for your high-end SLR lens?  Well, maybe it is if you are considering the Tiffen 77mm UV Protection Filter.\n\nThis filter does NOT offer the highest level of UV filtration, but it is rather sufficient for most conditions, and the build quality and materials used in this filter are very good.  For most digital SLR users, a UV filter is a must have for protecting your lens optics, and it helps to clear up the hazy and washed out look in many of your outdoor photos.  This filter has proven to clean up many of my digital photographs, and I have found almost no internal reflection artifacts.  Notice I said ALMOST no internal reflection.  I leave my UV filters on all of my lenses almost all of the time, and this filter has produced some minor reflection when shooting indoor photos with my Sigma 10-20mm ultra-wide angle lens.  This seems to only happen when shooting in dim lighting conditions, and when aiming the lens in the direction of a strong light source, such as a table lamp.  Since my Canon EOS 40D has a \"Live View\" feature that lets me see what the picture is going to look like (displayed on the 3\" LCD), I can see the reflection artifacts before I shoot the picture, and therefore have found ways to reframe my shots to avoid the reflections.  However, I recommend that you simply remove the UV filter when shooting in these conditions.\n\nAs I said before, I typically do not recommend buying low cost filters for your high quality lenses, but I prefer to invest my money on creative filters and not pour too much into a filter that is primarily used to simply protect the front of the lens.  Many manufacturers, including Tiffen, offer higher quality UV/Haze filters for SLR lenses, and you may wish to spend the extra money if you are looking for deeper UV removal from your pictures.  However, if you are looking for great lens protection and a decent level of UV filtration for a modest investment, you honestly can't go wrong with this filter.  Just remember to remove the filter, or frame your shots carefully when shooting in situations where direct light reflection may be an issue.\n\nQuality = **** (4)\nUV Filtration = **** (4)\nValue = ***** (5)\nOutput:",

At first look I nearly passed on them but figured I'd give them a quick wash and see if they had any potential. I started by power washing them. The \"wet look\" gave me hope and, once dry, I proceeded to sand them with my palm sander. They looked so good I decided to take the next step and order the kit. I used the cleaner and brightener using stainless steel wool as per the instructions and, in the areas I had not sanded well, it did make a difference, but I can't say the results were particularly noticeable, in fairness I did not put in a whole lot of effort either. The icing on the cake was the teak oil, it really brought out the deep rich color of the wood and, 3 months later, they still bead when wet and have the wet look.\n\nNote that in this kit you get a pint of each \"flavor\". The cleaner and brightener were enough for my 2 already prepped chairs, but if starting from scratch I bet you would need a pint for each chair. Since they were so dry from years of neglect each chair required a full pint of teak oil; I gave each chair 3 liberal coats, allowing them to dry between coats.\n\nSince I was in the middle of the project when I realized I would need more I ran down to the local ACE hardware to buy more oil, it was competitively priced compared to amazon and came in 32 oz. sizes. I don't know how this oil compares to other brands, but as it's a commodity I doubt one brand of oil is much different than another.\nOutput:",

    "input_field": "Instructions: Evaluate the following product review on a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 being very negative and 5 being very positive. \nInput: I'm giving a 4 star review for these earphones with a couple big caveats.  I've owned a lot of portable headphones throughout the years and most recently have used a set of Koss SportaPros that have served me well; they sound good (not as good as the PortaPros, but still good) and were pretty cheap.  But they leak sound terribly, meaning they're not a great choice for listening on a crowded subway or while at work, and also are not that convenient to carry around.  When I recently bought an iPod and finally got to try out some in-ear headphones, I loved the convenience of being able to stuff both my player and the phones into one pocket when not in use, but I never could get the stock iPod headphones to fit my ear.  They didn't sound particularly good either.  So I knew I wanted to try something else.\n\nI first bought a pair of Sennheiser MX-500's, and while I actually liked their sound a lot (better than the stock iPod phones), they didn't fit my ears any better.  They'd fall out even if I so much as turned my head to one side.  One of my co-workers then recommended The Plug, and at such a low price I figured I'd give them a shot.\n\nI've now spent a few days with mine and my feelings on the whole are mixed, but I do feel these earphones are a pretty good value.  Most importantly to me is that so far, they're the only in-ear headphones I've found that don't seem to require constant fiddling to ensure they stay in place.  I do have to use the largest of the several types of included cushions - I apparently have very large ear canals - but they seem fairly secure (though not tight) once they're in there.  Some people may find this type of earphone uncomfortable - you really have to place them well up into your ear canals (make sure you clean your ears well every day!) - but I find them much more comfortable than the standard designs included with most portable players because you don't have this piece of hard plastic wedged into your ear.\n\nSound-wise, I'd say they're fine, though certainly not remarkable.  My MX-500's sound better, and my SportaPros sound a *lot* better.  I'd put these about on par with the included iPod headphones.  They're pretty bass and mid-range heavy, though like other in-ear headphones the \"bass\" isn't really very bassy - it cuts off well above what most larger headphones can reproduce.  It ends up sounding a bit forced and artificially juiced, and there's a lot of this fake \"bass\".  On the high end, there's a lack of clarity - things like cymbal crashes sound \"muddy\" and ragged.  This is typical of low-end headphones of any type.\n\nStill, I'd rate the sound \"good enough\" considering the application most people will use these for (portable listening), and considering the increased comfort and dramatically better physical stability vs. more conventionally-designed in-ear headphones.\nOutput:",

With this USB reader, things work much more intuitively - there's no special application to deal with anymore.  The flash card simply appears as another icon on my iMac desktop, and I use the normal Finder operations to copy to/from it.\nMy only issue occurred in the initial setup.  My iMac was not recognizing the flash card as a legitimate device and would just keep displaying the error message \"Initialize or eject?\".  After a couple of emails and phone calls to customer support, I realized that I needed the \"File Exchange\" control panel enabled (it used to be called \"PC Exchange\", I believe).

The ability to play disks of MP3s wherever I go is just so cool. I've got 159 songs on one CD and 138 on another. If you set up your MP3 disk with folders for artists and albums, the Mojo makes it really easy to  move around and play what you want.\nA word about the FIF format: TDK talks a lot about \"converting\" your MP3 files to FIF, which scared me at first. \"Converting\" is the wrong word. FIF isn't a format; it's just a way of naming your MP3s so the Mojo can pick out artists and titles. The Mojo works best if you name your MP3s as \"Artist-Title\".  The Mojo comes with software to help you rename the files, but as you can see it's simple. Most people I know name their MP3s \"Artist-Title\" already.\nFIF is how the Mojo can show you a list of the artists on a disk. It shows you everything before the dash (-) in your filenames. For song titles, it shows you everything after the dash. Works well, but the lists it displays are not alphabetical. I can't find any logic to them. If you've got a disk of 100 artists, it would really help to see them alphabetically, not a jumble.\nOne real downside to the Mojo is it won't play my Music CD-Rs well. I'm talking about CD-Rs specifically labeled \"For Music Only,\" which I've burned with WAV files. I've got several Maxell ones, and they play fine in every device I have except the Mojo. I've been using these disks for a couple of years, but I'm going to have to switch to standard CD-Rs. I've heard that \"Music\" CD-Rs don't go through as much testing as multipurpose disks. The Mojo is probably picking up imperfections that all my other CD players don't notice. Multipurpose CD-Rs full of WAV files play fine in the Mojo, so just avoid the disks labeled \"Music.\"\nThe Mojo could have used some flashier styling. It doesn't look year-2001 at all. But the 4-line display and simple buttons are better than most other devices of this kind. Exception: the volume buttons are up/down on the player, but the volume bar is left/right on the display. I'm always pressing the left/right buttons on the player to change the volume and accidentally changing tracks.\nOutput:",

We decided to go ahead and purchase \"real\" binoculars for her so she could really use them in her kit. She has used them for playing, but also enjoys finding birds and animals in our yard as well. It is a little challenging for her to hold them steady, but she is getting better. I like that they are sturdy and come with their own carrying case.

I looked at the Popiel Showtime grill but decided against it because of the reviews that I read here on Amazon.com.  They were so inconsistent that I was afraid the quality control was poor.  So I opted for Mr. Foreman's rotisserie after reading the reviews.  They are all right on.  It's easy to clean except for the back plate (that's what lost the one star) - however, I use SOS pads and it comes clean (although scratched - it's up to you - stained or scratched).  The first thing I cooked was a chicken.  As many reviews have stated, it does come out perfect like a deli rotisserie chicken.  The instructions do not give a lot of help with cooking times, so check the meat periodically with a thermometer so you don't over-cook it.  The next thing I cooked was a rolled roast (a test for an upcoming dinner party).  I cooked it 20 minutes to the pound, but with the additional sitting, it came out medium (I like medium rare).  When I cooked another rolled roast for my dinner party, I calculated 15 minutes to the pound and checked the temperature.  At that point it was a bit underdone, so I added 15 minutes.  The point is, if you like medium rare beef, cook it until it is 130-135 and then turn it off and let it sit.  The final roast will be about 140 to 145 (I hope).  Experiment with your machine, learn it's quirks, and I'm sure you'll be very satisfied.  I've used this machine 3 times in the two weeks since I bought it.  If you cook roasts or whole chicken often, this is a good buy.\nOutput:",

It looks like it will stop casual theft by requiring a thief to cut off the cover before unscrewing the bolt.\n\nIt seems a bit pricy for a lock, but the bike carrier is an expensive enough item to make some precautions worthwhile.  I was able to save a few dollars on both the rack and the Snug-Tite lock by shopping around.\n\nAfter a few weeks of use, I found that the Snug-Tite Lock's bolt had backed out slightly from vibration, letting the rack become slightly loose in the hitch receiver. Application of a mild thread locking compound (Blue Loc-Tight or similar) solved the problem.\nOutput:",

It's not a conventional 35mm SLR camera but this thing is so close I am still amazed. Picture quality (for a digital) is superb! The battery pack is long-lasting, allowing you to take an endless parade of pictures before needing a recharge (and I have a 256 meg card in mine). The camera has sufficient weight to feel solid but is quite compact. And it's the first digital camera that I've actually had luck with the red-eye reduction feature. The 3X optical zoom is a blessing when you want to zoom in on something and still retain great clarity (digital zoom creates a grainy picture)and I've captured some fascinating pictures with the macro feature that allows you to get in close for detail shots or capturing the small things in the world. The different shooting modes make picture taking nearly fool-proof but the camera is flexible enough to allow you to be \"creative\" if and when you want to be.\nThe movie feature allows you to capture \"mini\" movies of 30 second duration. Though the movie picture is small and grainy (compared to its regular shooting modes), it's a great little feature for capturing those spur-of-the-moment things.\nImprovements I'd like to see are faster focusing, shorter processing time, and shorter start-up time (program load-up) but these things are minor and can be overcome by simply knowing what to expect as I grow more accustomed to the camera's \"personality.\"\nAm I happy with the G2?  No.  I'm ecstatic!  It was worth every penny of its price. With its great image clarity, great focusing (though it can be a little tricky at times), and countless little features to explore, the Canon Powershot G2 is a heavenly piece of technology that actually exceeded my expectations quite handsomely. And if you're not very familiar with cameras, don't let all the little extras deter you from enjoying this gem because you can use it like a point-and-click (with focusing) until you're ready to explore its more advanced features.\nIn short, this G2 is a sweet digital camera!\nOutput:",

First, I've been a carpenter for nine years. i work on framing and finish job-sites, and need a good knife everyday. This is the only knife i will purchase, and only the second model of knife I have owned on a job-site. The first knife I owned was a older one with a screw. These are fantastic and never fail, but very slow on the blade change. About 8 years ago I bought one of these rapid change stanleys. It took a while to get used to. I bought it cause it was the only rapid change available that would fit in my designated knife pocket on my tool bags. All the other ones available were too wide. This knife is excellent once i got used to changing the blade. I probably own about six of these and have even sold a couple. These blades do get clogged and i have completely taken apart several on mine and cleaned them up, back to perfect working order. I would not recommend this knife for drywallers. The drywall clogs the parts very easily and you will spend more time taking it apart than using it. But, for everyone else this is a good knife. On all my knifes it is extremely quick and easy to change out the blades. I've never bought one that was faulty or impossible to change blades. I own so many, because at sears i came across on clearance a 25' fatmax and this stanley knife in a package deal for $10. I bought all the ones they had since the knife alone at home depot costs $10. So, getting back to the negative reviews for this knife. I am fully aware of the idiocy that is out there. I actually worked in Mississippi for two years and even they liked this knife. I did have to instruct them carefully on how to change the blades, because like most morons they give up and call things crap just cause its not rated for a two year old. I understand peoples frustrations, but don't take it out on a quality product. Just cause there seems to be a learning curve with this knife does not in anyway make it a poor design. It is durable and takes all the punishment that i can dish out without breaking. And again, for me, just like it should be for everyone , it is extremely quick and easy to change the blades.\nOutput:",

We have cats and a two-year-old daughter, which means the floor is always covered in fur balls, crumbs, and cat litter that's been tracked through the laundry room. This vacuum is so much easier and faster than sweeping ever was and it gets everything. The suction is amazing and leaves the floor actually feeling clean, something I've not found with other hardwood floor vacuums I've tried. In a pinch, the vacuum can do a once-over on your carpet or area rugs and get the big stuff, but don't expect it to replace a normal upright brush vacuum for carpet. The attachments it came with are great, though I added some length to the handle using old hose attachments from my shop-vac. With the lengthy handle and wide, flat brush attachment it came with, I can easily vacuum all the way under my king size bed, my daughter's crib, and the kitchen island without moving them. My floors stay so much cleaner now than they ever have, as I no longer dread cleaning them like I used to. Coming from someone who really detests cleaning, this is saying something!\nOutput:",

The original halogen bulbs create a large amount of heat, and do not last, especially when on every night.  Another issue with original bulbs is that the color and warmth of the light will change depending on the manufacturer of the bulb.  You may get a harsh white, or a softer yellow tint, very obvious when looking at the lights.\n\nThese lights are all the same color (bright but not harsh), perfect for replacement bulbs.  They also are as bright as the original halogen bulbs.  While I have not had them for a length of time, based on LED technology, I would anticipate they will last longer than the original halogen bulbs, and will consume less power, costing less over time.\n\nSo far, very happy with the purchase.\nOutput:",

Your fingers aren't in danger of being chopped off in the process either, because you don't have to hold the herbs while you chop.  Just rock the *very sharp* curved blade over the herbs.

It is quiet and powerful.  The first time I used it, I couldn't tell if the blender was doing its job or not.  The power is so strong and quiet, that tough jobs are done without a sweat, and without hearing the motor getting slow and cranky.  It is so smooth, that even when you crush ice or make frozen strawberry smoothies, you feel like you are just blending soft spinach.  You don't hear the blades, or the solid ice cubes or frozen strawberrys getting stuck and freeze your motor, if you know what I mean.  I am comparing this with my old and trusted Hamilton Beach Commercial Blender, which I own for 12 year.  Dear Hamilton  Beach, don't take me wrong, your blender is great, but it makes too much noise, you hear scary noises when crushing ice, like the jar will explode; and taking your blender to service or changing the rubber cluch myself, takes just too much work and time, I rather just order a new blender from KichenAid at Amazon.  GET ONE.  (hints for the sad owners:  learn how to blend and you will know how to avoid chunks!!!  Feel your blender, talk to it, and know when it asks you to pulse, stop, rest, and pulse again.... gravity makes chunks fall to the bottown when turned off... no blender is designed to just blend everything in one step... be a good cook, and be interactive when using your baby, if you think one push of a button will do your meal, just order take out).\nOutput:",

I am using this on an EOS 30D (updated posting: and also 40D) with their excellent&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Canon-EF-100mm-f-2-8-Macro-USM-Lens-for-Canon-SLR-Cameras/dp/B00004XOM3/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Canon EF 100mm f/2.8 Macro USM Lens for Canon SLR Cameras</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Canon-MP-E-65mm-f-2-8-1-5X-Macro-Lens-for-Canon-SLR-Cameras/dp/B00009XVD5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Canon MP-E 65mm f/2.8 1-5X Macro Lens for Canon SLR Cameras</a>&nbsp;along with a&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Canon-Macrolite-Adapter-58C-for-Canon-G2-G3-G5-G6-Pro1-Digital-Cameras/dp/B00006HRMH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Canon Macrolite Adapter 58C for Canon G2, G3, G5, G6 & Pro1 Digital Cameras</a>\n\nEven though the \"Canon Macrolite Adapter 58C\" says that it is for G2-G6 cameras, it fits their 65mm and 100mm Macro Lens also due to its 58mm size.  The flash secures onto grooves in their 100mm Macro Lens, but if you prefer to leave a UV-haze filter on that lens, the filter covers up the groove.  Therefore, to not have to remove the protective UV-haze filter lens in order to attach the ring lite, you need to screw the \"Canon Macrolite Adapter 58C\" onto the end of the filter lens, which then provides the grooves that the ring lite then attaches to.  Yes, $15 is still a bit pricey for a skinny little ring of plastic adapter, but comparable to how Canon prices their lens hoods also... and it is the only way to attach the ring lite to the macro lens while still leaving a UV-haze filter screwed on (without resorting to black duck tape :-)\n\nI use this ring lite for both indoor and outdoor nature macro photography and it is the perfect flash when the natural lighting is less than optimal.  A macro ring light like this is optional equipment if you use Canon's 50mm, 60mm, 100mm, or 180mm macro lenses.  But either this flash or the more expensive&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Canon-MT-24EX-Macro-Twin-Lite-Flash-for-Canon-Digital-SLR-Cameras/dp/B00006I548/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Canon MT-24EX Macro Twin Lite Flash for Canon Digital SLR Cameras</a>&nbsp;macro flash is really absolutely required equipment if you use the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Canon-MP-E-65mm-f-2-8-1-5X-Macro-Lens-for-Canon-SLR-Cameras/dp/B00009XVD5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Canon MP-E 65mm f/2.8 1-5X Macro Lens for Canon SLR Cameras</a>&nbsp;lens, especially if you do not always use a tripod.  The diffuser plastic that is on this flash gives it a nice soft warm light that is not too harsh.  You can adjust the \"ratio\" so that one of the half-circle ring's flashes are brighter than the other half-circle flash, to get better shadow contrast (when zooming the MP-E 65mm between 3X to 5X, I like to use a ratio of 3:1 or 4:1).  The MT-24EX does have a distinct advantage over this MR-14EX when using Canon's MP-E 65mm at magnifications of 4X or 5X because the MT-24EX's two flash heads can be positioned and angled more directly at the subject.  But I find the MT-24EX's light to be more harsh than this MR-14EX, unless you create your own diffuser setup for it.\n\nJuly 22 2010 update: Since my original writing of my review, I sold my&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Canon-EF-100mm-f-2-8-Macro-USM-Lens-for-Canon-SLR-Cameras/dp/B00004XOM3/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Canon EF 100mm f/2.8 Macro USM Lens for Canon SLR Cameras</a>&nbsp;and bought the newer&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Canon-EF-100mm-f-2-8L-IS-USM-1-to-1-Macro-Lens-for-Canon-Digital-SLR-Cameras/dp/B002NEGTSI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Canon EF 100mm f/2.8L IS USM 1-to-1 Macro Lens for Canon Digital SLR Cameras</a>.

I'm so excited for Spring to arrive, because lord knows I won't be spending too much time indoors once flowers start blooming!  I'm very anxious to see the full capability of this lens.  I've used it a few times, just for practice, but nothing to elaborate.  The one thing that it's hard for me to get used to though is how hard it is to keep an object focused.  Once I've zoomed in on a subject, the slightest movement of my body moves the image out of focus, which is kind of frustrating.  But regardless, I'm very pleased and glad that I purchased this lens!!  Everything that I read out it before I purchased it said that it was the best lens out there for Macro photography.

Em comes out with some intelligence in his third installment as the greatest MC of our generation. Don't listen to the pathetic Moby fan who reviewed this cd as a one-star affair, he's just mad that Em put that punk in his place. From the opening track to the final skit, this cd is about as good as a cd can possibly be. Em doesn't attack people for the hell of it, as he had on previous records, instead this album plays out much more like a journal. The lyrics on this album are awesome, the beats are by far the best to date since Em himself produced most of this album, and the message behind the music is the most thoughtful it has ever been from Em. \"Hailie's Song\" is a song he wrote to his daughter(Em actually pulls of this semi-ballad), and it is such a good reminder that Em is actually a human being and loves his daughter just as you or I would. He's not the monster that he once portraid, and he proves it again on the song entitled, \"Cleaning out my closet\" in which he goes a little deeper into the actual feud with his mother, instead of just bashing her as he did on the Slim Shady LP. Overall, the best Eminem record to date, and anyone with a true appriciation for Hip-Hop will appriciate his growth as an artist, and anyone too immature to value that growth or the change of view in his music will appriciate it someday. Get the record, you'll like it sooner or later\nOutput:",

I keep the lense part of the camera bay long so no matter what lense is on the camera, I can put it away quickly.\n\nThe outside of the bag is water repellent, although I haven't tested the effectiveness of that yet. I'm from the Northwest, so I'll get plenty of chances when I return from Iraq.\n\nAnother review mentioned the chest strap almost being a neck strap...I can see that, as it does ride high. It is somewhat adjustable though, although their range of adjustment really should have taken it lower down the straps. I adjusted mine all the way down and it made it better.\n\nAll in all, I highly recommend this camera backpack. I've had a few Lowepro products before, and they are normally very well thought out and made with very good quality.\nOutput:",
