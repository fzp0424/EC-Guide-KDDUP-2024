Am doing my last-minute gift wrapping/mailing for Christmas and realized I didn't have cards with the right values... so out these came.

The bushing, which is a softer material, looked similar to the OEM piece that had broken apart, after ten years. But it deformed in the desert heat, see photo.

They’re a little more on the expensive side, but with how long they last and how they fit it’s worth it! The only reason I gave 4 stars is because the screen print of “Safety 3rd” is definitely off center. Not that big of a deal, but noticeable.\nAspect List:\n1. heating efficiency\n2. image clarity\n3. fit\n4. design\n5. seller legitimacy\n6. decision\n7. lyrical content\n8. advertisements\n9. donation practice\n10. price\nOutput:",
